Jar is meant to run in terminal with connection and authentication credentials as arguments.
## Planned Usage:

## Status:
Running project's main method will subscribe to preset broker, saving received files to a preset file.

Project is still in its infancy.

Basic functionality is implemented, but jars can't even take arguments, etc.

Next steps are validations and terminal usability.

The long term goal is to assure connection and data security.
